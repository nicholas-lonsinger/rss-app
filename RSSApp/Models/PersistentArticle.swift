    // RATIONALE: Thumbnail state is stored directly on PersistentArticle rather than in a
    // separate model because SwiftData @Model classes cannot use enums with associated values
    // as persisted properties, and a separate one-to-one model would add join overhead for
    // every article query. Two scalar fields are the simplest SwiftData-compatible approach.

    var fetchedDate: Date

    // MARK: - Sort Key

    // RATIONALE: `sortDate` is a separate persisted field — distinct from `publishedDate`
    // — because real-world feeds publish scheduled posts whose `pubDate` lies hours in
    // the future relative to fetch time (e.g., the Cloudflare blog announces upcoming
    // content). Sorting by raw `publishedDate` would pin those future-dated articles to
    // the top of newest-first lists and let them shield genuinely-old articles from
    // retention. `sortDate` is computed at insert via `clampedSortDate(publishedDate:)`,
    // clamping any future date to ingestion time, while `publishedDate` is preserved
    // verbatim for a planned content-update detection feature that compares pubDate
    // values across refreshes.
    //
    // **Stability invariant: do not mutate `sortDate` after insert.** The "computed
    // once" property is enforced *behaviorally* by `FeedPersistenceService.upsertArticles`,
    // which skips existing rows on re-fetch — so `sortDate` is set exactly once per row
    // in production. Any future code path that touches `sortDate` on an already-persisted
    // article (most likely candidate: the planned content-update detection feature, when
    // it starts mutating articles in place rather than skipping them) must justify the
    // drift, because reshuffling articles after the user has seen them is a UX regression
    // and breaks the "fresh from when we ingested it" guarantee. SwiftData requires
    // `var` here, so this invariant cannot be enforced at the type level.
